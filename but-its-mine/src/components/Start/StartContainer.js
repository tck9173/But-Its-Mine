            <h2>Before you start</h2>
            <h3>Why PC? And why build your own?</h3>
            <p>PCs are generally thought of as too expensive or not worth it when it comes to gaming. The truth is, PCs offer higher performance for gaming, including higher framerate and higher resolution even at higher quality. Dollar for dollar, you can do more with a PC. The latest systems may seem like a good value, and they are if the only thing you plan to do is game. While the main reason a lot of us build a PC is gaming, there are dozens of other things you can do with a desktop computer. Highend gaming PCs also make great workstations for CAD, video production, coding, and dozens of other examples.</p>
            <p>So if you plan on doing anything other than gaming, the choice is clear. PCs are a better value. So why build your own? A couple of the main reasons are increased customization, lower cost, and pride of ownership. Building a PC is not difficult but can decrease the cost of ownership compared to pre-built PCs or laptops. Sometimes you can save as much as 50% compared to gaming laptops. And if you build your own PC there is no greater feeling than knowing you built your PC everytime you boot.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure, keep doing your research, post questions in the forum, and do the math to see if if makes sense to build your own.</p>
            <h3>Set Expectations</h3>
            <p>Did we convince you? That's great!</p>
            <p>Now that we have convinced you we need to set some expectations. In your research you might have seen some beautiful highend watercooled systems complete with triple monitor setup and componanion TV. It is completely fine that your setup is simple, especially for your first build. Your system does not need to please anyone except you.</p>           
            <p>Before you start planning a to build a PC think realistically what you need it to do. Will you be using this PC for work? Do you want to game at 1080p? Or 1440p? What refresh rate do you want to run at? Everyone wants to game at the highest possible settings, but for your budget that may not be realistic.</p>
            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>The planning phase can be the most stressful part of building a PC but it's also the most important. You not only need to plan what performance you need but you need to pick parts that will provide this performance while staying in budget and not causing any bottleneck.</p>
            <p>This can be stressful but don't worry! There are a lot of resources including example builds, videoes, and the forum on this site can be used to ask questions and check out other builds in the community.</p>
            <h3>Building</h3>
            <p>Now comes the fun part, building it! Check out the build page when you are ready to put your PC together.</p>
            <h3>....Now What?</h3>
            <p>A lot of build guides end when you boot for the first time, but the PC journey has only started. You need to ensure Windows is installed corerctly, as well as any other software you will be using. There are a lot of settings in the BIOS that can affect performance, and there are a lot of options for benchmarking. Getting through this phase may be daunting but take your time, do your research and you will get through this phase as well.</p>
