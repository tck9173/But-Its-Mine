            <p>This is my new 3D workstation setup. Nothing custom or fancy. Just need stability and less problems. The main picture of my desk is reused from my older build because I just changed the insides :-)</p>
            <p>Whenever I upgrade my main workstation, I move the GPUs and CPUs to the render node on the top, and the ones on the top to my wife's computer.</p>
            <p>Happy to answer any questions!</p>
